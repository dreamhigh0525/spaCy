spaCy is non-free software. Its source is published, but the copyright is
retained by the author (Matthew Honnibal).  Licenses are currently under preparation.

There is currently a gap between the output of academic NLP researchers, and
the needs of a small software companiess. I left academia to try to correct this.
My idea is that non-commercial and trial commercial use should "feel" just like
free software. But, if you do use the code in a commercial product, a small
fixed license-fee will apply, in order to fund development.
