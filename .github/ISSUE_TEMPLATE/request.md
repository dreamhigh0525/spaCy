## Feature description
<!-- Please describe the feature: Which area of the library is it related to? What specific solution would you like? -->

## Could the feature be a [custom component](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components) or [spaCy plugin](https://spacy.io/universe)?
If so, we will tag it as [`project idea`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/labels/project%20idea) so other users can take it on.
