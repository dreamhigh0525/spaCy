            +h(2) Built for Production
            p.u-text-medium Most AI software is built for research.  Over the last ten years, we've used a lot of that software, and built some of it ourselves, especially for natural language processing (NLP). But the faster the research has moved, the more impatient we've become. We want to see advanced NLP technologies get out into great products, as the basis of great businesses. We built spaCy to make that happen.

            +h(2) Easy and Powerful
            p.u-text-medium For any NLP task, there are always lots of competing algorithms. We don't believe in implementing them all and letting you choose. Instead, we just implement one &ndash; the best one. When better algorithms are developed, we can update the library without breaking your code or bloating the API. This approach makes spaCy both #[strong easier] and #[strong more powerful] than a pluggable architecture. spaCy also features a #[strong unique whole-document design]. Where other NLP libraries rely on sentence detection as a pre-process, spaCy reads the whole document at once, making it much more robust to informal and poorly formatted text.

            +h(2) Permissive open-source license (MIT)
            p.u-text-medium We think spaCy is valuable software, so we made it free, to raise its value even higher. Making spaCy open-source puts us on the same side &ndash; we can tell you everything about how it works, and let you run it however you like. We think the software would be much less valuable as a service, which could disappear at any point.

                .h2 What we do

            p.text-big spaCy helps you write programs that do clever things with text.  You give it a string of characters, it gives you an object that provides multiple useful views of its meaning and linguistic structure.  Specifically, spaCy features a high performance tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, named entity recognizer and syntactic dependency parser, with built-in support for word vectors. All of the functionality is united behind a clean high-level Python API, that makes it easy to use the different annotations together.
            
            p.text-big To make spaCy as fast and easy to install as we could, we built it #[strong from the ground up] from custom components, with #[strong custom implementations], and sometimes #[strong custom algorithms]. It's written in clean but efficient Cython code, which allows us to manage both low level details and the high-level Python API in a single codebase.
