+h(3, "example-train-parser") Updating the parser

p
    |  This example shows how to train spaCy's dependency parser, starting off
    |  with an existing model or a blank model. You'll need a set of
    |  #[strong training examples] and the respective #[strong heads] and
    |  #[strong dependency label] for each token of the example texts.

        |  #[strong Load the model] you want to start with, or create an
        |  #[strong empty model] using
        |  #[+api("spacy#blank") #[code spacy.blank]] with the ID of your
        |  language. If you're using a blank model, don't forget to add the
        |  parser to the pipeline. If you're using an existing model,
        |  make sure to disable all other pipeline components during training
        |  using #[+api("language#disable_pipes") #[code nlp.disable_pipes]].
        |  This way, you'll only be training the parser.

    +item
        |  #[strong Add the dependency labels] to the parser using the
        |  #[+api("dependencyparser#add_label") #[code add_label]] method. If
        |  you're starting off with a pre-trained spaCy model, this is usually
        |  not necessary â€“ but it doesn't hurt either, just to be safe.

    +item
        |  #[strong Shuffle and loop over] the examples and create a
        |  #[code Doc] and #[code GoldParse] object for each example. Make sure
        |  to pass in the #[code heads] and #[code deps] when you create the
        |  #[code GoldParse].

    +item
        |  For each example, #[strong update the model]
        |  by calling #[+api("language#update") #[code nlp.update]], which steps
        |  through the words of the input. At each word, it makes a
        |  #[strong prediction]. It then consults the annotations provided on the
        |  #[code GoldParse] instance, to see whether it was
        |  right. If it was wrong, it adjusts its weights so that the correct
        |  action will score higher next time.

    +item
        |  #[strong Save] the trained model using
        |  #[+api("language#to_disk") #[code nlp.to_disk]].

    +item
        |  #[strong Test] the model to make sure the parser works as expected.
