A developer can define input data streams and design simple annotation interfaces. Prodigy can help break down complex annotation decisions into a series of binary decisions, and it provides easy integration with spaCy models. Developers can specify how models should be modified as new annotations come in in an active learning framework.",

In our conversation, Ines gives us an overview of the spaCy Library, a look at some of the use cases that excite her, and the Spacy community and contributors. We also discuss her work with Prodigy, an annotation service tool that uses continuous active learning to train models, and finally, what other exciting projects she is working on.\"",

            "description": "EcoHealth Alliance uses EpiTator to catalog the what, where and when of infectious disease case counts reported in online news. Each of these aspects is extracted using independent annotators than can be applied to other domains. EpiTator organizes annotations by creating \"AnnoTiers\" for each type. AnnoTiers have methods for manipulating, combining and searching annotations. For instance, the `with_following_spans_from()` method can be used to create a new tier that combines a tier of one type (such as numbers), with another (say, kitchenware). The resulting tier will contain all the phrases in the document that match that pattern, like \"5 plates\" or \"2 cups.\"\n\nAnother commonly used method is `group_spans_by_containing_span()` which can be used to do things like find all the spaCy tokens in all the GeoNames a document mentions. spaCy tokens, named entities, sentences and noun chunks are exposed through the spaCy annotator which will create a AnnoTier for each. These are basis of many of the other annotators. EpiTator also includes an annotator for extracting tables embedded in free text articles. Another neat feature is that the lexicons used for entity resolution are all stored in an embedded sqlite database so there is no need to run any external services in order to use EpiTator.",

However, while the genetic changes that occur within cancer cells themselves, such as activated oncogenes or dysfunctional tumor suppressors, are responsible for many aspects of cancer development, they are not sufficient. Tumor promotion and progression are dependent on ancillary processes provided by cells of the tumor environment but that are not necessarily cancerous themselves. Inflammation has long been associated with the development of cancer. This review will discuss the reflexive relationship between cancer and inflammation with particular focus on how considering the role of inflammation in physiologic processes such as the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair may provide a logical framework for understanding the connection between the inflammatory response and cancer.'",
