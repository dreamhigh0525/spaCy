                        spaCy is designed to help you do real work — to build real products, or
                        gather real insights. The library respects your time, and tries to avoid
                        wasting it. It's easy to install, and its API is simple and productive. We
                        like to think of spaCy as the Ruby on Rails of Natural Language Processing.

                        spaCy excels at large-scale information extraction tasks. It's written from
                        the ground up in carefully memory-managed Cython. Independent research in
                        2015 found spaCy to be the fastest in the world. If your application needs
                        to process entire web dumps, spaCy is the library you want to be using.

                    Prodigy is an <strong>annotation tool</strong> so efficient that data scientists
                    can do the annotation themselves, enabling a new level of rapid iteration.
                    Whether you're working on entity recognition, intent detection or image
                    classification, Prodigy can help you <strong>train and evaluate</strong> your
                    models faster. Stream in your own examples or real-world data from live APIs,
                    update your model in real-time and chain models together to build more complex
                    systems.

                    each other and exchange ideas. The YouTube playlist includes 12 talks about NLP
                    research, development and applications, with keynotes by Sebastian Ruder

                Learn more from small training corpora by initializing your models with{' '}
                <strong>knowledge from raw text</strong>. The new pretrain command teaches spaCy's
                CNN model to predict words based on their context, producing representations of
                words in contexts. If you've seen Google's BERT system or fast.ai's ULMFiT, spaCy's
                pretraining is similar – but much more efficient. It's still experimental, but users
                are already reporting good results, so give it a try!
