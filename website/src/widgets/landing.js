                        spaCy excels at large-scale information extraction tasks. It's written from
                        the ground up in carefully memory-managed Cython. Independent research has
                        confirmed that spaCy is the fastest in the world. If your application needs
                        to process entire web dumps, spaCy is the library you want to be using.

                        wasting it. It's easy to install, and its API is simple and productive. We
                        like to think of spaCy as the Ruby on Rails of Natural Language Processing.

                spaCy v2.0 features new neural models for <strong>tagging</strong>,{' '}
                <strong>parsing</strong> and <strong>entity recognition</strong>. The models have
                been designed and implemented from scratch specifically for spaCy, to give you an
                unmatched balance of speed, size and accuracy. A novel bloom embedding strategy with
                subword features is used to support huge vocabularies in tiny tables. Convolutional
                layers with residual connections, layer normalization and maxout non-linearity are
                used, giving much better efficiency than the standard BiLSTM solution. Finally, the
                parser and NER use an imitation learning objective to deliver accuracy in-line with
                the latest research systems, even when evaluated from raw text. With these
                innovations, spaCy v2.0's models are <strong>10× smaller</strong>,{' '}
                <strong>20% more accurate</strong>, and
                <strong>even cheaper to run</strong> than the previous generation.
