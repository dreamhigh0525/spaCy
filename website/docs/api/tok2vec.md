## Default config {#config}

This is the default configuration used to initialize the model powering the
pipeline component. See the [model architectures](/api/architectures)
documentation for details on the architectures and their arguments and
hyperparameters. To learn more about how to customize the config and train
custom models, check out the [training config](/usage/training#config) docs.
