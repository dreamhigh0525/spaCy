+h(2, "annotations") Linguistic annotations

p
    |  spaCy provides a variety of linguistic annotations to give you insights
    |  into a text's grammatical structure. This includes the word types,
    |  i.e. the parts of speech, and how the words are related to each other.
    |  For example, if you're analysing text, it makes a #[em huge] difference
    |  whether a noun is the subject of a sentence, or the object â€“ or whether
    |  "google" is used as a verb, or refers to the website or company in a
    |  specific context.

p
    |  Once you've downloaded and installed a #[+a("/docs/usage/models") model],
    |  you can load it via #[+api("spacy#load") #[code spacy.load()]]. This will
    |  return a #[code Language] object contaning all components and data needed
    |  to process text. We usually call it #[code nlp]. Calling the #[code nlp]
    |  object on a string of text will return a processed #[code Doc]:

+code.
    import spacy

    nlp = spacy.load('en')
    doc = nlp(u'Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion')

p
    |  Even though a #[code Doc] is processed â€“ e.g. split into individual words
    |  and annotated â€“ it still holds #[strong all information of the original text],
    |  like whitespace characters. This way, you'll never lose any information
    |  when processing text with spaCy.
