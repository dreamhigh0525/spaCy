    |  Model differences are mostly statistical. In general, we do expect larger
    |  models to be "better" and more accurate overall. Ultimately, it depends on
    |  your use case and requirements, and we recommend starting with the default
    |  models (marked with a star below).

+aside
    |  Models are now available as #[code .tar.gz] archives #[+a(gh("spacy-models")) from GitHub],
    |  attached to individual releases. They can be downloaded and loaded manually,
    |  or using spaCy's #[code download] and #[code link] commands. All models
    |  follow the naming convention of #[code [language]_[type]_[genre]_[size]].
