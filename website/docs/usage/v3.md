## Summary {#summary}

## New Features {#features}

## Backwards Incompatibilities {#incompat}

### Removed deprecated methods, attributes and arguments {#incompat-removed}

The following deprecated methods, attributes and arguments were removed in v3.0.
Most of them have been deprecated for quite a while now and many would
previously raise errors. Many of them were also mostly internals. If you've been
working with more recent versions of spaCy v2.x, it's unlikely that your code
relied on them.
