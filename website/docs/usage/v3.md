### Removed or renamed objects, methods, attributes and arguments {#incompat-removed}

### Removed deprecated methods, attributes and arguments {#incompat-removed-deprecated}

The following deprecated methods, attributes and arguments were removed in v3.0.
Most of them have been **deprecated for a while** and many would previously
raise errors. Many of them were also mostly internals. If you've been working
with more recent versions of spaCy v2.x, it's **unlikely** that your code relied
on them.

## Migrating from v2.x {#migrating}

### Downloading and loading models {#migrating-downloading-models}

Model symlinks and shortcuts like `en` are now officially deprecated. There are
[many different models](/models) with different capabilities and not just one
"English model". In order to download and load a model, you should always use
its full name â€“ for instance, `en_core_web_sm`.

```diff
- python -m spacy download en
+ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

```diff
- nlp = spacy.load("en")
+ nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
```

### Custom pipeline components and factories {#migrating-pipeline-components}

Custom pipeline components now have to be registered explicitly using the
[`@Language.component`](/api/language#component) or
[`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator. For simple functions
that take a `Doc` and return it, all you have to do is add the
`@Language.component` decorator to it and assign it a name:

```diff
### Stateless function components
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.component("my_component")
def my_component(doc):
    return doc
```

For class components that are initialized with settings and/or the shared `nlp`
object, you can use the `@Language.factory` decorator. Also make sure that that
the method used to initialize the factory has **two named arguments**: `nlp`
(the current `nlp` object) and `name` (the string name of the component
instance).

```diff
### Stateful class components
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.factory("my_component")
class MyComponent:
-   def __init__(self, nlp):
+   def __init__(self, nlp, name):
        self.nlp = nlp

    def __call__(self, doc):
        return doc
```

Instead of decorating your class, you could also add a factory function that
takes the arguments `nlp` and `name` and returns an instance of your component:

```diff
### Stateful class components with factory function
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.factory("my_component")
+ def create_my_component(nlp, name):
+     return MyComponent(nlp)

class MyComponent:
    def __init__(self, nlp):
        self.nlp = nlp

    def __call__(self, doc):
        return doc
```

The `@Language.component` and `@Language.factory` decorators now take care of
adding an entry to the component factories, so spaCy knows how to load a
component back in from its string name. You won't have to write to
`Language.factories` manually anymore.

```diff
- Language.factories["my_component"] = lambda nlp, **cfg: MyComponent(nlp)
```

#### Adding components to the pipeline {#migrating-add-pipe}

The [`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) method now takes the **string
name** of the component factory instead of a callable component. This allows
spaCy to track and serialize components that have been added and their settings.

```diff
+ @Language.component("my_component")
def my_component(doc):
    return doc

- nlp.add_pipe(my_component)
+ nlp.add_pipe("my_component")
```

[`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) now also returns the pipeline component
itself, so you can access its attributes. The
[`nlp.create_pipe`](/api/language#create_pipe) method is now mostly internals
and you typically shouldn't have to use it in your code.

```diff
- parser = nlp.create_pipe("parser")
- nlp.add_pipe(parser)
+ parser = nlp.add_pipe("parser")
```

### Training models {#migrating-training}

To train your models, you should now pretty much always use the
[`spacy train`](/api/cli#train) CLI. You shouldn't have to put together your own
training scripts anymore, unless you _really_ want to. The training commands now
use a [flexible config file](/usage/training#config) that describes all training
settings and hyperparameters, as well as your pipeline, model components and
architectures to use. The `--code` argument lets you pass in code containing
[custom registered functions](/usage/training#custom-code) that you can
reference in your config.

#### Binary .spacy training data format {#migrating-training-format}

spaCy now uses a new
[binary training data format](/api/data-formats#binary-training), which is much
smaller and consists of `Doc` objects, serialized via the
[`DocBin`](/api/docbin). You can convert your existing JSON-formatted data using
the [`spacy convert`](/api/cli#convert) command, which outputs `.spacy` files:

```bash
$ python -m spacy convert ./training.json ./output
```

#### Training config {#migrating-training-config}

<!-- TODO: update once we have recommended "getting started with a new config" workflow -->

```diff
### {wrap="true"}
- python -m spacy train en ./output ./train.json ./dev.json --pipeline tagger,parser --cnn-window 1 --bilstm-depth 0
+ python -m spacy train ./train.spacy ./dev.spacy ./config.cfg --output ./output
```

<Project id="some_example_project">

The easiest way to get started with an end-to-end training process is to clone a
[project](/usage/projects) template. Projects let you manage multi-step
workflows, from data preprocessing to training and packaging your model.

</Project>

#### Migrating training scripts to CLI command and config {#migrating-training-scripts}

<!-- TODO: write -->

#### Training via the Python API {#migrating-training-python}

<!-- TODO: this should explain the GoldParse -> Example stuff -->

#### Packaging models {#migrating-training-packaging}

The [`spacy package`](/api/cli#package) command now automatically builds the
installable `.tar.gz` sdist of the Python package, so you don't have to run this
step manually anymore. You can disable the behavior by setting the `--no-sdist`
flag.

```diff
python -m spacy package ./model ./packages
- cd /output/en_model-0.0.0
- python setup.py sdist
```

## Migration notes for plugin maintainers {#plugins}

Thanks to everyone who's been contributing to the spaCy ecosystem by developing
and maintaining one of the many awesome [plugins and extensions](/universe).
We've tried to keep breaking changes to a minimum and make it as easy as
possible for you to upgrade your packages for spaCy v3.

### Custom pipeline components

The most common use case for plugins is providing pipeline components and
extension attributes.

- Use the [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator to register
  your component and assign it a name. This allows users to refer to your
  components by name and serialize pipelines referencing them. Remove all manual
  entries to the `Language.factories`.
- Make sure your component factories take at least two **named arguments**:
  `nlp` (the current `nlp` object) and `name` (the instance name of the added
  component so you can identify multiple instances of the same component).
- Update all references to [`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) in your docs
  to use **string names** instead of the component functions.

```python
### {highlight="1-5"}
from spacy.language import Language

@Language.factory("my_component", default_config={"some_setting": False})
def create_component(nlp: Language, name: str, some_setting: bool):
    return MyCoolComponent(some_setting=some_setting)


class MyCoolComponent:
    def __init__(self, some_setting):
        self.some_setting = some_setting

    def __call__(self, doc):
        # Do something to the doc
        return doc
```

> #### Result in config.cfg
>
> ```ini
> [components.my_component]
> factory = "my_component"
> some_setting = true
> ```

```diff
import spacy
from your_plugin import MyCoolComponent

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
- component = MyCoolComponent(some_setting=True)
- nlp.add_pipe(component)
+ nlp.add_pipe("my_component", config={"some_setting": True})
```

<Infobox title="Important note on registering factories" variant="warning">

The [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator takes care of letting
spaCy know that a component of that name is available. This means that your
users can add it to the pipeline using its **string name**. However, this
requires the decorator to be executed â€“ so users will still have to **import
your plugin**. Alternatively, your plugin could expose an
[entry point](/usage/saving-loading#entry-points), which spaCy can read from.
This means that spaCy knows how to initialize `my_component`, even if your
package isn't imported.
