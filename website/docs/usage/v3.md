<Grid cols={2} gutterBottom={false}>

<div>

spaCy v3.0 features all new **transformer-based pipelines** that bring spaCy's
accuracy right up to the current **state-of-the-art**. You can use any
pretrained transformer to train your own pipelines, and even share one
transformer between multiple components with **multi-task learning**. Training
is now fully configurable and extensible, and you can define your own custom
models using **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow** and other frameworks. The new spaCy
projects system lets you describe whole **end-to-end workflows** in a single
file, giving you an easy path from prototype to production, and making it easy
to clone and adapt best-practice projects for your own use cases.

## New Features {#features}

This section contains an overview of the most important **new features and
improvements**. The [API docs](/api) include additional deprecation notes. New
methods and functions that were introduced in this version are marked with the
tag <Tag variant="new">3</Tag>.

### Transformer-based pipelines {#features-transformers}

> #### Example
>
> ```cli
> $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
> ```

spaCy v3.0 features all new transformer-based pipelines that bring spaCy's
accuracy right up to the current **state-of-the-art**. You can use any
pretrained transformer to train your own pipelines, and even share one
transformer between multiple components with **multi-task learning**. spaCy's
transformer support interoperates with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and the
[HuggingFace `transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library,
giving you access to thousands of pretrained models for your pipelines.

### New training workflow and config system {#features-training}

> #### Example
>
> ```ini
> [training]
> vectors = null
> accumulate_gradient = 3
>
> [training.optimizer]
> @optimizers = "Adam.v1"
>
> [training.optimizer.learn_rate]
> @schedules = "warmup_linear.v1"
> warmup_steps = 250
> total_steps = 20000
> initial_rate = 0.01
> ```

spaCy v3.0 introduces a comprehensive and extensible system for **configuring
your training runs**. A single configuration file describes every detail of your
training run, with no hidden defaults, making it easy to rerun your experiments
and track changes. You can use the
[quickstart widget](/usage/training#quickstart) or the `init config` command to
get started. Instead of providing lots of arguments on the command line, you
only need to pass your `config.cfg` file to `spacy train`.

Training config files include all **settings and hyperparameters** for training
your pipeline. Some settings can also be registered **functions** that you can
swap out and customize, making it easy to implement your own custom models and
architectures.

<Infobox title="Details & Documentation" emoji="ðŸ“–" list>

- **Usage:** [Training pipelines and models](/usage/training)
- **Thinc:** [Thinc's config system](https://thinc.ai/docs/usage-config),
  [`Config`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-config#config)
- **CLI:** [`init config`](/api/cli#init-config),

### Custom models using any framework {#features-custom-models}

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> from torch import nn
> from thinc.api import PyTorchWrapper
>
> torch_model = nn.Sequential(
>     nn.Linear(32, 32),
>     nn.ReLU(),
>     nn.Softmax(dim=1)
> )
> model = PyTorchWrapper(torch_model)
> ```

spaCy's new configuration system makes it easy to customize the neural network
models used by the different pipeline components. You can also implement your
own architectures via spaCy's machine learning library [Thinc](https://thinc.ai)
that provides various layers and utilities, as well as thin wrappers around
frameworks like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow** and **MXNet**. Component models all
follow the same unified [`Model`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-model) API and each
`Model` can also be used as a sublayer of a larger network, allowing you to
freely combine implementations from different frameworks into a single model.

### Manage end-to-end workflows with projects {#features-projects}

<!-- TODO: update example -->

> #### Example
>
> ```cli
> # Clone a project template
> $ python -m spacy project clone example
> $ cd example
> # Download data assets
> $ python -m spacy project assets
> # Run a workflow
> $ python -m spacy project run train
> ```

spaCy projects let you manage and share **end-to-end spaCy workflows** for
different **use cases and domains**, and orchestrate training, packaging and
serving your custom pipelines. You can start off by cloning a pre-defined
project template, adjust it to fit your needs, load in your data, train a
pipeline, export it as a Python package, upload your outputs to a remote storage
and share your results with your team.

![Illustration of project workflow and commands](../images/projects.svg)

spaCy projects also make it easy to **integrate with other tools** in the data
science and machine learning ecosystem, including [DVC](/usage/projects#dvc) for
data version control, [Prodigy](/usage/projects#prodigy) for creating labelled
data, [Streamlit](/usage/projects#streamlit) for building interactive apps,
[FastAPI](/usage/projects#fastapi) for serving models in production,
[Ray](/usage/projects#ray) for parallel training,
[Weights & Biases](/usage/projects#wandb) for experiment tracking, and more!

<!-- <Project id="some_example_project">

The easiest way to get started with an end-to-end training process is to clone a
[project](/usage/projects) template. Projects let you manage multi-step
workflows, from data preprocessing to training and packaging your pipeline.

</Project>-->

### Parallel and distributed training with Ray {#features-parallel-training}

> #### Example
>
> ```cli
> $ pip install spacy-ray
> # Check that the CLI is registered
> $ python -m spacy ray --help
> # Train a pipeline
> $ python -m spacy ray train config.cfg --n-workers 2
> ```

[Ray](https://ray.io/) is a fast and simple framework for building and running
**distributed applications**. You can use Ray to train spaCy on one or more
remote machines, potentially speeding up your training process. The Ray
integration is powered by a lightweight extension package,
[`spacy-ray`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-ray), that automatically adds
the [`ray`](/api/cli#ray) command to your spaCy CLI if it's installed in the
same environment. You can then run [`spacy ray train`](/api/cli#ray-train) for
parallel training.

### New built-in pipeline components {#features-pipeline-components}

spaCy v3.0 includes several new trainable and rule-based components that you can
add to your pipeline and customize for your use case:

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> # pip install spacy-lookups-data
> nlp = spacy.blank("en")
> nlp.add_pipe("lemmatizer")
> ```

| Name                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`SentenceRecognizer`](/api/sentencerecognizer) | Trainable component for sentence segmentation.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [`Morphologizer`](/api/morphologizer)           | Trainable component to predict morphological features.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [`Lemmatizer`](/api/lemmatizer)                 | Standalone component for rule-based and lookup lemmatization.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [`AttributeRuler`](/api/attributeruler)         | Component for setting token attributes using match patterns.                                                                                                                                                            |
| [`Transformer`](/api/transformer)               | Component for using [transformer models](/usage/embeddings-transformers) in your pipeline, accessing outputs and aligning tokens. Provided via [`spacy-transformers`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-transformers). |

<Infobox title="Details & Documentation" emoji="ðŸ“–" list>

- **Usage:** [Processing pipelines](/usage/processing-pipelines)
- **API:** [Built-in pipeline components](/api#architecture-pipeline)
- **Implementation:** [`spacy/pipeline`](%%GITHUB_SPACY/spacy/pipeline)

</Infobox>

### New and improved pipeline component APIs {#features-components}

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> @Language.component("my_component")
> def my_component(doc):
>     return doc
>
> nlp.add_pipe("my_component")
> nlp.add_pipe("ner", source=other_nlp)
> nlp.analyze_pipes(pretty=True)
> ```

Defining, configuring, reusing, training and analyzing pipeline components is
now easier and more convenient. The `@Language.component` and
`@Language.factory` decorators let you register your component, define its
default configuration and meta data, like the attribute values it assigns and
requires. Any custom component can be included during training, and sourcing
components from existing trained pipelines lets you **mix and match custom
pipelines**. The `nlp.analyze_pipes` method outputs structured information about
the current pipeline and its components, including the attributes they assign,
the scores they compute during training and whether any required attributes
aren't set.

<Infobox title="Details & Documentation" emoji="ðŸ“–" list>

- **Usage:** [Custom components](/usage/processing-pipelines#custom_components),
  [Defining components for training](/usage/training#config-components)
- **API:** [`@Language.component`](/api/language#component),
  [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory),
  [`Language.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe),
  [`Language.analyze_pipes`](/api/language#analyze_pipes)
- **Implementation:** [`spacy/language.py`](%%GITHUB_SPACY/spacy/language.py)

</Infobox>

### Dependency matching {#features-dep-matcher}

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> from spacy.matcher import DependencyMatcher
>
> matcher = DependencyMatcher(nlp.vocab)
> pattern = [
>     {"RIGHT_ID": "anchor_founded", "RIGHT_ATTRS": {"ORTH": "founded"}},
>     {"LEFT_ID": "anchor_founded", "REL_OP": ">", "RIGHT_ID": "subject", "RIGHT_ATTRS": {"DEP": "nsubj"}}
> ]
> matcher.add("FOUNDED", [pattern])
> ```

The new [`DependencyMatcher`](/api/dependencymatcher) lets you match patterns
within the dependency parse using
[Semgrex](https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/semgraph/semgrex/SemgrexPattern.html)
operators. It follows the same API as the token-based [`Matcher`](/api/matcher).
A pattern added to the dependency matcher consists of a **list of
dictionaries**, with each dictionary describing a **token to match** and its
**relation to an existing token** in the pattern.

![Dependency matcher pattern](../images/dep-match-diagram.svg)

<Infobox title="Details & Documentation" emoji="ðŸ“–" list>

- **Usage:**
  [Dependency matching](/usage/rule-based-matching#dependencymatcher),
- **API:** [`DependencyMatcher`](/api/dependencymatcher),
- **Implementation:**
  [`spacy/matcher/dependencymatcher.pyx`](%%GITHUB_SPACY/spacy/matcher/dependencymatcher.pyx)

</Infobox>

### Type hints and type-based data validation {#features-types}

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> from spacy.language import Language
> from pydantic import StrictBool
>
> @Language.factory("my_component")
> def create_my_component(
>     nlp: Language,
>     name: str,
>     custom: StrictBool
> ):
>    ...
> ```

spaCy v3.0 officially drops support for Python 2 and now requires **Python
3.6+**. This also means that the code base can take full advantage of
[type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). spaCy's user-facing
API that's implemented in pure Python (as opposed to Cython) now comes with type
hints. The new version of spaCy's machine learning library
[Thinc](https://thinc.ai) also features extensive
[type support](https://thinc.ai/docs/usage-type-checking/), including custom
types for models and arrays, and a custom `mypy` plugin that can be used to
type-check model definitions.

For data validation, spaCy v3.0 adopts
[`pydantic`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic). It also powers the data
validation of Thinc's [config system](https://thinc.ai/docs/usage-config), which
lets you to register **custom functions with typed arguments**, reference them
in your config and see validation errors if the argument values don't match.

### New and updated documentation {#new-docs}

<Grid cols={2} gutterBottom={false}>

<div>

To help you get started with spaCy v3.0 and the new features, we've added
several new or rewritten documentation pages, including a new usage guide on
[embeddings, transformers and transfer learning](/usage/embeddings-transformers),
a guide on [training pipelines and models](/usage/training) rewritten from
scratch, a page explaining the new [spaCy projects](/usage/projects) and updated
usage documentation on
[custom pipeline components](/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components).
We've also added a bunch of new illustrations and new API reference pages
documenting spaCy's machine learning [model architectures](/api/architectures)
and the expected [data formats](/api/data-formats). API pages about
[pipeline components](/api/#architecture-pipeline) now include more information,
like the default config and implementation, and we've adopted a more detailed
format for documenting argument and return types.

## Backwards Incompatibilities {#incompat}

As always, we've tried to keep the breaking changes to a minimum and focus on
changes that were necessary to support the new features, fix problems or improve
usability. The following section lists the relevant changes to the user-facing
API. For specific examples of how to rewrite your code, check out the
[migration guide](#migrating).

<Infobox variant="warning">

Note that spaCy v3.0 now requires **Python 3.6+**.

</Infobox>

### API changes {#incompat-api}

- Pipeline package symlinks, the `link` command and shortcut names are now
  deprecated. There can be many [different trained pipelines](/models) and not
  just one "English model", so you should always use the full package name like
  [`en_core_web_sm`](/models/en) explicitly.
- A pipeline's [`meta.json`](/api/data-formats#meta) is now only used to provide
  meta information like the package name, author, license and labels. It's
  **not** used to construct the processing pipeline anymore. This is all defined
  in the [`config.cfg`](/api/data-formats#config), which also includes all
  settings used to train the pipeline.
- The [`train`](/api/cli#train) and [`pretrain`](/api/cli#pretrain) commands now
  only take a `config.cfg` file containing the full
  [training config](/usage/training#config).
- [`Language.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) now takes the **string name** of
  the component factory instead of the component function.
- **Custom pipeline components** now need to be decorated with the
  [`@Language.component`](/api/language#component) or
  [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator.
- [`Language.update`](/api/language#update) now takes a batch of
  [`Example`](/api/example) objects instead of raw texts and annotations, or
  `Doc` and `GoldParse` objects.
- The `Language.disable_pipes` context manager has been replaced by
  [`Language.select_pipes`](/api/language#select_pipes), which can explicitly
  disable or enable components.
- The [`Language.update`](/api/language#update),
  [`Language.evaluate`](/api/language#evaluate) and
  [`Pipe.update`](/api/pipe#update) methods now all take batches of
  [`Example`](/api/example) objects instead of `Doc` and `GoldParse` objects, or
  raw text and a dictionary of annotations.
  [`Language.begin_training`](/api/language#begin_training) and
  [`Pipe.begin_training`](/api/pipe#begin_training) now take a function that
  returns a sequence of `Example` objects to initialize the model instead of a
  list of tuples.
- [`Matcher.add`](/api/matcher#add) and
  [`PhraseMatcher.add`](/api/phrasematcher#add) now only accept a list of
  patterns as the second argument (instead of a variable number of arguments).
  The `on_match` callback becomes an optional keyword argument.
- The `spacy.gold` module has been renamed to
  [`spacy.training`](%%GITHUB_SPACY/spacy/training).
- The `PRON_LEMMA` symbol and `-PRON-` as an indicator for pronoun lemmas has
  been removed.
- The `TAG_MAP` and `MORPH_RULES` in the language data have been replaced by the
  more flexible [`AttributeRuler`](/api/attributeruler).
- The [`Lemmatizer`](/api/lemmatizer) is now a standalone pipeline component and
  doesn't provide lemmas by default or switch automatically between lookup and
  rule-based lemmas. You can now add it to your pipeline explicitly and set its
  mode on initialization.
- Various keyword arguments across functions and methods are now explicitly
  declared as _keyword-only_ arguments. Those arguments are documented
  accordingly across the API reference.

The following deprecated methods, attributes and arguments were removed in v3.0.
Most of them have been **deprecated for a while** and many would previously
raise errors. Many of them were also mostly internals. If you've been working
with more recent versions of spaCy v2.x, it's **unlikely** that your code relied
on them.

## Migrating from v2.x {#migrating}

### Downloading and loading trained pipelines {#migrating-downloading-models}

Symlinks and shortcuts like `en` are now officially deprecated. There are
[many different trained pipelines](/models) with different capabilities and not
just one "English model". In order to download and load a package, you should
always use its full name â€“ for instance,
[`en_core_web_sm`](/models/en#en_core_web_sm).

```diff
- python -m spacy download en
+ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

```diff
- nlp = spacy.load("en")
+ nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
```

### Custom pipeline components and factories {#migrating-pipeline-components}

Custom pipeline components now have to be registered explicitly using the
[`@Language.component`](/api/language#component) or
[`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator. For simple functions
that take a `Doc` and return it, all you have to do is add the
`@Language.component` decorator to it and assign it a name:

```diff
### Stateless function components
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.component("my_component")
def my_component(doc):
    return doc
```

For class components that are initialized with settings and/or the shared `nlp`
object, you can use the `@Language.factory` decorator. Also make sure that that
the method used to initialize the factory has **two named arguments**: `nlp`
(the current `nlp` object) and `name` (the string name of the component
instance).

```diff
### Stateful class components
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.factory("my_component")
class MyComponent:
-   def __init__(self, nlp):
+   def __init__(self, nlp, name):
        self.nlp = nlp

    def __call__(self, doc):
        return doc
```

Instead of decorating your class, you could also add a factory function that
takes the arguments `nlp` and `name` and returns an instance of your component:

```diff
### Stateful class components with factory function
+ from spacy.language import Language

+ @Language.factory("my_component")
+ def create_my_component(nlp, name):
+     return MyComponent(nlp)

class MyComponent:
    def __init__(self, nlp):
        self.nlp = nlp

    def __call__(self, doc):
        return doc
```

The `@Language.component` and `@Language.factory` decorators now take care of
adding an entry to the component factories, so spaCy knows how to load a
component back in from its string name. You won't have to write to
`Language.factories` manually anymore.

```diff
- Language.factories["my_component"] = lambda nlp, **cfg: MyComponent(nlp)
```

#### Adding components to the pipeline {#migrating-add-pipe}

The [`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) method now takes the **string
name** of the component factory instead of a callable component. This allows
spaCy to track and serialize components that have been added and their settings.

```diff
+ @Language.component("my_component")
def my_component(doc):
    return doc

- nlp.add_pipe(my_component)
+ nlp.add_pipe("my_component")
```

[`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) now also returns the pipeline component
itself, so you can access its attributes. The
[`nlp.create_pipe`](/api/language#create_pipe) method is now mostly internals
and you typically shouldn't have to use it in your code.

```diff
- parser = nlp.create_pipe("parser")
- nlp.add_pipe(parser)
+ parser = nlp.add_pipe("parser")
```

If you need to add a component from an existing trained pipeline, you can now
use the `source` argument on [`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe). This will
check that the component is compatible, and take care of porting over all
config. During training, you can also reference existing trained components in
your [config](/usage/training#config-components) and decide whether or not they
should be updated with more data.

> #### config.cfg (excerpt)
>
> ```ini
> [components.ner]
> source = "en_core_web_sm"
> component = "ner"
> ```

```diff
source_nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp = spacy.blank("en")
- ner = source_nlp.get_pipe("ner")
- nlp.add_pipe(ner)
+ nlp.add_pipe("ner", source=source_nlp)
```

### Adding match patterns {#migrating-matcher}

The [`Matcher.add`](/api/matcher#add),
[`PhraseMatcher.add`](/api/phrasematcher#add) and
[`DependencyMatcher.add`](/api/dependencymatcher#add) methods now only accept a
**list of patterns** as the second argument (instead of a variable number of
arguments). The `on_match` callback becomes an optional keyword argument.

```diff
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
patterns = [[{"TEXT": "Google"}, {"TEXT": "Now"}], [{"TEXT": "GoogleNow"}]]
- matcher.add("GoogleNow", on_match, *patterns)
+ matcher.add("GoogleNow", patterns, on_match=on_match)
```

```diff
matcher = PhraseMatcher(nlp.vocab)
patterns = [nlp("health care reform"), nlp("healthcare reform")]
- matcher.add("HEALTH", on_match, *patterns)
+ matcher.add("HEALTH", patterns, on_match=on_match)
```

### Migrating attributes in tokenizer exceptions {#migrating-tokenizer-exceptions}

Tokenizer exceptions are now only allowed to set `ORTH` and `NORM` values as
part of the token attributes. Exceptions for other attributes such as `TAG` and
`LEMMA` should be moved to an [`AttributeRuler`](/api/attributeruler) component:

```diff
nlp = spacy.blank("en")
- nlp.tokenizer.add_special_case("don't", [{"ORTH": "do"}, {"ORTH": "n't", "LEMMA": "not"}])
+ nlp.tokenizer.add_special_case("don't", [{"ORTH": "do"}, {"ORTH": "n't"}])
+ ruler = nlp.add_pipe("attribute_ruler")
+ ruler.add(patterns=[[{"ORTH": "n't"}]], attrs={"LEMMA": "not"})
```

### Migrating tag maps and morph rules {#migrating-training-mappings-exceptions}

Instead of defining a `tag_map` and `morph_rules` in the language data, spaCy
v3.0 now manages mappings and exceptions with a separate and more flexible
pipeline component, the [`AttributeRuler`](/api/attributeruler). See the
[usage guide](/usage/linguistic-features#mappings-exceptions) for examples. The
`AttributeRuler` provides two handy helper methods
[`load_from_tag_map`](/api/attributeruler#load_from_tag_map) and
[`load_from_morph_rules`](/api/attributeruler#load_from_morph_rules) that let
you load in your existing tag map or morph rules:

```diff
nlp = spacy.blank("en")
- nlp.vocab.morphology.load_tag_map(YOUR_TAG_MAP)
+ ruler = nlp.add_pipe("attribute_ruler")
+ ruler.load_from_tag_map(YOUR_TAG_MAP)
```

### Training pipelines and models {#migrating-training}

To train your pipelines, you should now pretty much always use the
[`spacy train`](/api/cli#train) CLI. You shouldn't have to put together your own
training scripts anymore, unless you _really_ want to. The training commands now
use a [flexible config file](/usage/training#config) that describes all training
settings and hyperparameters, as well as your pipeline, components and
architectures to use. The `--code` argument lets you pass in code containing
[custom registered functions](/usage/training#custom-code) that you can
reference in your config. To get started, check out the
[quickstart widget](/usage/training#quickstart).

#### Binary .spacy training data format {#migrating-training-format}

spaCy v3.0 uses a new
[binary training data format](/api/data-formats#binary-training) created by
serializing a [`DocBin`](/api/docbin), which represents a collection of `Doc`
objects. This means that you can train spaCy pipelines using the same format it
outputs: annotated `Doc` objects. The binary format is extremely **efficient in
storage**, especially when packing multiple documents together. You can convert
your existing JSON-formatted data using the [`spacy convert`](/api/cli#convert)
command, which outputs `.spacy` files:

```cli
$ python -m spacy convert ./training.json ./output
```

#### Training config {#migrating-training-config}

The easiest way to get started with a training config is to use the
[`init config`](/api/cli#init-config) command or the
[quickstart widget](/usage/training#quickstart). You can define your
requirements, and it will auto-generate a starter config with the best-matching
default settings.

```cli
$ python -m spacy init config ./config.cfg --lang en --pipeline tagger,parser
```

If you've exported a starter config from our
[quickstart widget](/usage/training#quickstart), you can use the
[`init fill-config`](/api/cli#init-fill-config) to fill it with all default
values. You can then use the auto-generated `config.cfg` for training:

```diff
- python -m spacy train en ./output ./train.json ./dev.json
--pipeline tagger,parser --cnn-window 1 --bilstm-depth 0
+ python -m spacy train ./config.cfg --output ./output
```

#### Training via the Python API {#migrating-training-python}

For most use cases, you **shouldn't** have to write your own training scripts
anymore. Instead, you can use [`spacy train`](/api/cli#train) with a
[config file](/usage/training#config) and custom
[registered functions](/usage/training#custom-code) if needed. You can even
register callbacks that can modify the `nlp` object at different stages of its
lifecycle to fully customize it before training.

If you do decide to use the [internal training API](/usage/training#api) from
Python, you should only need a few small modifications to convert your scripts
from spaCy v2.x to v3.x. The [`Example.from_dict`](/api/example#from_dict)
classmethod takes a reference `Doc` and a
[dictionary of annotations](/api/data-formats#dict-input), similar to the
"simple training style" in spaCy v2.x:

```diff
### Migrating Doc and GoldParse
doc = nlp.make_doc("Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook")
entities = [(0, 15, "PERSON"), (30, 38, "ORG")]
- gold = GoldParse(doc, entities=entities)
+ example = Example.from_dict(doc, {"entities": entities})
```

```diff
### Migrating simple training style
text = "Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook"
annotations = {"entities": [(0, 15, "PERSON"), (30, 38, "ORG")]}
+ doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
+ example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)
```

The [`Language.update`](/api/language#update),
[`Language.evaluate`](/api/language#evaluate) and
[`Pipe.update`](/api/pipe#update) methods now all take batches of
[`Example`](/api/example) objects instead of `Doc` and `GoldParse` objects, or
raw text and a dictionary of annotations.

```python
### Training loop {highlight="11"}
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("Who is Shaka Khan?", {"entities": [(7, 17, "PERSON")]}),
    ("I like London.", {"entities": [(7, 13, "LOC")]}),
]
nlp.begin_training()
for i in range(20):
    random.shuffle(TRAIN_DATA)
    for batch in minibatch(TRAIN_DATA):
        examples = []
        for text, annots in batch:
            examples.append(Example.from_dict(nlp.make_doc(text), annots))
        nlp.update(examples)
```

[`Language.begin_training`](/api/language#begin_training) and
[`Pipe.begin_training`](/api/pipe#begin_training) now take a function that
returns a sequence of `Example` objects to initialize the model instead of a
list of tuples. The data examples are used to **initialize the models** of
trainable pipeline components, which includes validating the network,
[inferring missing shapes](https://thinc.ai/docs/usage-models#validation) and
setting up the label scheme.

```diff
- nlp.begin_training(examples)
+ nlp.begin_training(lambda: examples)
```

#### Packaging trained pipelines {#migrating-training-packaging}

The [`spacy package`](/api/cli#package) command now automatically builds the
installable `.tar.gz` sdist of the Python package, so you don't have to run this
step manually anymore. You can disable the behavior by setting the `--no-sdist`
flag.

```diff
python -m spacy package ./output ./packages
- cd /output/en_pipeline-0.0.0
- python setup.py sdist
```

#### Data utilities and gold module {#migrating-gold}

The `spacy.gold` module has been renamed to `spacy.training`. This mostly
affects internals, but if you've been using the span offset conversion utilities
[`biluo_tags_from_offsets`](/api/top-level#biluo_tags_from_offsets),
[`offsets_from_biluo_tags`](/api/top-level#offsets_from_biluo_tags) or
[`spans_from_biluo_tags`](/api/top-level#spans_from_biluo_tags), you'll have to
change your imports:

```diff
- from spacy.gold import biluo_tags_from_offsets, spans_from_biluo_tags
+ from spacy.training import biluo_tags_from_offsets, spans_from_biluo_tags
```

#### Migration notes for plugin maintainers {#migrating-plugins}

Thanks to everyone who's been contributing to the spaCy ecosystem by developing
and maintaining one of the many awesome [plugins and extensions](/universe).
We've tried to make it as easy as possible for you to upgrade your packages for
spaCy v3. The most common use case for plugins is providing pipeline components
and extension attributes. When migrating your plugin, double-check the
following:

- Use the [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator to register
  your component and assign it a name. This allows users to refer to your
  components by name and serialize pipelines referencing them. Remove all manual
  entries to the `Language.factories`.
- Make sure your component factories take at least two **named arguments**:
  `nlp` (the current `nlp` object) and `name` (the instance name of the added
  component so you can identify multiple instances of the same component).
- Update all references to [`nlp.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe) in your docs
  to use **string names** instead of the component functions.

```python
### {highlight="1-5"}
from spacy.language import Language

@Language.factory("my_component", default_config={"some_setting": False})
def create_component(nlp: Language, name: str, some_setting: bool):
    return MyCoolComponent(some_setting=some_setting)


class MyCoolComponent:
    def __init__(self, some_setting):
        self.some_setting = some_setting

    def __call__(self, doc):
        # Do something to the doc
        return doc
```

> #### Result in config.cfg
>
> ```ini
> [components.my_component]
> factory = "my_component"
> some_setting = true
> ```

```diff
import spacy
from your_plugin import MyCoolComponent

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
- component = MyCoolComponent(some_setting=True)
- nlp.add_pipe(component)
+ nlp.add_pipe("my_component", config={"some_setting": True})
```

<Infobox title="Important note on registering factories" variant="warning">

The [`@Language.factory`](/api/language#factory) decorator takes care of letting
spaCy know that a component of that name is available. This means that your
users can add it to the pipeline using its **string name**. However, this
requires the decorator to be executed â€“ so users will still have to **import
your plugin**. Alternatively, your plugin could expose an
[entry point](/usage/saving-loading#entry-points), which spaCy can read from.
This means that spaCy knows how to initialize `my_component`, even if your
package isn't imported.
