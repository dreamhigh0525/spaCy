The central data structures in spaCy are the [`Language`](/api/language) class,
the [`Vocab`](/api/vocab) and the [`Doc`](/api/doc) object. The `Language` class
is used to process a text and turn it into a `Doc` object. It's typically stored
as a variable called `nlp`. The `Doc` object owns the **sequence of tokens** and
all their annotations. By centralizing strings, word vectors and lexical
attributes in the `Vocab`, we avoid storing multiple copies of this data. This
saves memory, and ensures there's a **single source of truth**.

Text annotations are also designed to allow a single source of truth: the `Doc`
object owns the data, and [`Span`](/api/span) and [`Token`](/api/token) are
**views that point into it**. The `Doc` object is constructed by the
[`Tokenizer`](/api/tokenizer), and then **modified in place** by the components
of the pipeline. The `Language` object coordinates these components. It takes
raw text and sends it through the pipeline, returning an **annotated document**.
It also orchestrates training and serialization.

### Container objects {#architecture-containers}

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`Language`](/api/language) | Processing class that turns text into `Doc` objects. Different languages implement their own subclasses of it. The variable is typically called `nlp`.  |
| [`Doc`](/api/doc)           | A container for accessing linguistic annotations.                                                                                                       |
| [`Span`](/api/span)         | A slice from a `Doc` object.                                                                                                                            |
| [`Token`](/api/token)       | An individual token â€” i.e. a word, punctuation symbol, whitespace, etc.                                                                                 |
| [`Lexeme`](/api/lexeme)     | An entry in the vocabulary. It's a word type with no context, as opposed to a word token. It therefore has no part-of-speech tag, dependency parse etc. |
| [`Example`](/api/example)   | A collection of training annotations, containing two `Doc` objects: the reference data and the predictions.                                             |
| [`DocBin`](/api/docbin)     | A collection of `Doc` objects for efficient binary serialization. Also used for [training data](/api/data-formats#binary-training).                     |

### Processing pipeline {#architecture-pipeline}

The processing pipeline consists of one or more **pipeline components** that are
called on the `Doc` in order. The tokenizer runs before the components. Pipeline
components can be added using [`Language.add_pipe`](/api/language#add_pipe).
They can contain a statistical model and trained weights, or only make
rule-based modifications to the `Doc`. spaCy provides a range of built-in
components for different language processing tasks and also allows adding
[custom components](/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components).

### Matchers {#architecture-matchers}

Matchers help you find and extract information from [`Doc`](/api/doc) objects
based on match patterns describing the sequences you're looking for. A matcher
operates on a `Doc` and gives you access to the matched tokens **in context**.
