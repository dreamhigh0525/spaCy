The central data structures in spaCy are the `Doc` and the `Vocab`. The `Doc`
object owns the **sequence of tokens** and all their annotations. The `Vocab`
object owns a set of **look-up tables** that make common information available
across documents. By centralizing strings, word vectors and lexical attributes,
we avoid storing multiple copies of this data. This saves memory, and ensures
there's a **single source of truth**.

Text annotations are also designed to allow a single source of truth: the `Doc`
object owns the data, and `Span` and `Token` are **views that point into it**.
The `Doc` object is constructed by the `Tokenizer`, and then **modified in
place** by the components of the pipeline. The `Language` object coordinates
these components. It takes raw text and sends it through the pipeline, returning
an **annotated document**. It also orchestrates training and serialization.
