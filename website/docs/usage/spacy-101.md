## What's spaCy? {#whats-spacy}

<Grid cols={2}>

<div>

spaCy is a **free, open-source library** for advanced **Natural Language
Processing** (NLP) in Python.

If you're working with a lot of text, you'll eventually want to know more about
it. For example, what's it about? What do the words mean in context? Who is
doing what to whom? What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are
similar to each other?

spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build
applications that process and "understand" large volumes of text. It can be used
to build **information extraction** or **natural language understanding**
systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.

### What spaCy isn't {#what-spacy-isnt}

- **spaCy is not a platform or "an API"**. Unlike a platform, spaCy does not
  provide a software as a service, or a web application. It's an open-source
  library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.

- **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine**. While spaCy can be used to
  power conversational applications, it's not designed specifically for chat
  bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.

- **spaCy is not research software**. It's built on the latest research, but
  it's designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design
  decisions than [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) or
  [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), which were created as
  platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is
  integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose
  between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the
  menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer
  experience.M

- **spaCy is not a company**. It's an open-source library. Our company
  publishing spaCy and other software is called
  [Explosion AI](https://explosion.ai).

## Features {#features}

In the documentation, you'll come across mentions of spaCy's features and
capabilities. Some of them refer to linguistic concepts, while others are
related to more general machine learning functionality.

| **Serialization**                     | Saving objects to files or byte strings.                                                                           |

### Statistical models {#statistical-models}

While some of spaCy's features work independently, others require
[ statistical models](/models) to be loaded, which enable spaCy to **predict**
linguistic annotations – for example, whether a word is a verb or a noun. spaCy
currently offers statistical models for a variety of languages, which can be
installed as individual Python modules. Models can differ in size, speed, memory
usage, accuracy and the data they include. The model you choose always depends
on your use case and the texts you're working with. For a general-purpose use
case, the small, default models are always a good start. They typically include
the following components:

- **Binary weights** for the part-of-speech tagger, dependency parser and named
  entity recognizer to predict those annotations in context.
- **Lexical entries** in the vocabulary, i.e. words and their
  context-independent attributes like the shape or spelling.
- **Word vectors**, i.e. multi-dimensional meaning representations of words that
  let you determine how similar they are to each other.
- **Configuration** options, like the language and processing pipeline settings,
  to put spaCy in the correct state when you load in the model.

## Linguistic annotations {#annotations}

spaCy provides a variety of linguistic annotations to give you **insights into a
text's grammatical structure**. This includes the word types, like the parts of
speech, and how the words are related to each other. For example, if you're
analyzing text, it makes a huge difference whether a noun is the subject of a
sentence, or the object – or whether "google" is used as a verb, or refers to
the website or company in a specific context.

> #### Loading models
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
>
> >>> import spacy
> >>> nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
> ```

Once you've [downloaded and installed](/usage/models) a model, you can load it
via [`spacy.load()`](/api/top-level#spacy.load). This will return a `Language`
object containing all components and data needed to process text. We usually
call it `nlp`. Calling the `nlp` object on a string of text will return a
processed `Doc`:

```python
### {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
```

Even though a `Doc` is processed – e.g. split into individual words and
annotated – it still holds **all information of the original text**, like
whitespace characters. You can always get the offset of a token into the
original string, or reconstruct the original by joining the tokens and their
trailing whitespace. This way, you'll never lose any information when processing
text with spaCy.

</Infobox>

## Vocab, hashes and lexemes {#vocab}

Whenever possible, spaCy tries to store data in a vocabulary, the
[`Vocab`](/api/vocab), that will be **shared by multiple documents**. To save
memory, spaCy also encodes all strings to **hash values** – in this case for
example, "coffee" has the hash `3197928453018144401`. Entity labels like "ORG"
and part-of-speech tags like "VERB" are also encoded. Internally, spaCy only
"speaks" in hash values.

> - **Token**: A word, punctuation mark etc. _in context_, including its
>   attributes, tags and dependencies.
> - **Lexeme**: A "word type" with no context. Includes the word shape and
>   flags, e.g. if it's lowercase, a digit or punctuation.
> - **Doc**: A processed container of tokens in context.
> - **Vocab**: The collection of lexemes.
> - **StringStore**: The dictionary mapping hash values to strings, for example
>   `3197928453018144401` → "coffee".

![Doc, Vocab, Lexeme and StringStore](../images/vocab_stringstore.svg)

If you process lots of documents containing the word "coffee" in all kinds of
different contexts, storing the exact string "coffee" every time would take up
way too much space. So instead, spaCy hashes the string and stores it in the
[`StringStore`](/api/stringstore). You can think of the `StringStore` as a
**lookup table that works in both directions** – you can look up a string to get
its hash, or a hash to get its string:

```python
### {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"I love coffee")
print(doc.vocab.strings[u"coffee"])  # 3197928453018144401
print(doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee'
```

> #### What does 'L' at the end of a hash mean?
>
> If you return a hash value in the **Python 2 interpreter**, it'll show up as
> `3197928453018144401L`. The `L` just means "long integer" – it's **not**
> actually a part of the hash value.

Now that all strings are encoded, the entries in the vocabulary **don't need to
include the word text** themselves. Instead, they can look it up in the
`StringStore` via its hash value. Each entry in the vocabulary, also called
[`Lexeme`](/api/lexeme), contains the **context-independent** information about
a word. For example, no matter if "love" is used as a verb or a noun in some
context, its spelling and whether it consists of alphabetic characters won't
ever change. Its hash value will also always be the same.

```python
### {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"I love coffee")
for word in doc:
    lexeme = doc.vocab[word.text]
    print(lexeme.text, lexeme.orth, lexeme.shape_, lexeme.prefix_, lexeme.suffix_,
            lexeme.is_alpha, lexeme.is_digit, lexeme.is_title, lexeme.lang_)
```

> - **Text**: The original text of the lexeme.
> - **Orth**: The hash value of the lexeme.
> - **Shape**: The abstract word shape of the lexeme.
> - **Prefix**: By default, the first letter of the word string.
> - **Suffix**: By default, the last three letters of the word string.
> - **is alpha**: Does the lexeme consist of alphabetic characters?
> - **is digit**: Does the lexeme consist of digits?

| Text   | Orth                  | Shape  | Prefix | Suffix | is_alpha | is_digit |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| I      | `4690420944186131903` | `X`    | I      | I      | `True`   | `False`  |
| love   | `3702023516439754181` | `xxxx` | l      | ove    | `True`   | `False`  |
| coffee | `3197928453018144401` | `xxxx` | c      | fee    | `True`   | `False`  |

The mapping of words to hashes doesn't depend on any state. To make sure each
value is unique, spaCy uses a
[hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to calculate the
hash **based on the word string**. This also means that the hash for "coffee"
will always be the same, no matter which model you're using or how you've
configured spaCy.

However, hashes **cannot be reversed** and there's no way to resolve
`3197928453018144401` back to "coffee". All spaCy can do is look it up in the
vocabulary. That's why you always need to make sure all objects you create have
access to the same vocabulary. If they don't, spaCy might not be able to find
the strings it needs.

```python
### {executable="true"}
import spacy
from spacy.tokens import Doc
from spacy.vocab import Vocab

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"I love coffee")  # Original Doc
print(doc.vocab.strings[u"coffee"])  # 3197928453018144401
print(doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍

empty_doc = Doc(Vocab())  # New Doc with empty Vocab
# empty_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401] will raise an error :(

empty_doc.vocab.strings.add(u"coffee")  # Add "coffee" and generate hash
print(empty_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍

new_doc = Doc(doc.vocab)  # Create new doc with first doc's vocab
print(new_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍
```

If the vocabulary doesn't contain a string for `3197928453018144401`, spaCy will
raise an error. You can re-add "coffee" manually, but this only works if you
actually _know_ that the document contains that word. To prevent this problem,
spaCy will also export the `Vocab` when you save a `Doc` or `nlp` object. This
will give you the object and its encoded annotations, plus the "key" to decode
it.

### Calculate inline markup on original string {#lightning-tour-inline}

```python
### {executable="true"}
import spacy

def put_spans_around_tokens(doc):
    """Here, we're building a custom "syntax highlighter" for
    part-of-speech tags and dependencies. We put each token in a
    span element, with the appropriate classes computed. All whitespace is
    preserved, outside of the spans. (Of course, HTML will only display
    multiple whitespace if enabled – but the point is, no information is lost
    and you can calculate what you need, e.g. <br />, <p> etc.)
    """
    output = []

## Community & FAQ {#community-faq}

We're very happy to see the spaCy community grow and include a mix of people
from all kinds of different backgrounds – computational linguistics, data
science, deep learning, research and more. If you'd like to get involved, below
are some answers to the most important questions and resources for further
reading.

### Help, my code isn't working! {#faq-help-code}

Bugs suck, and we're doing our best to continuously improve the tests and fix
bugs as soon as possible. Before you submit an issue, do a quick search and
check if the problem has already been reported. If you're having installation or
loading problems, make sure to also check out the
[troubleshooting guide](/usage/#troubleshooting). Help with spaCy is available
via the following platforms:

> #### How do I know if something is a bug?
>
> Of course, it's always hard to know for sure, so don't worry – we're not going
> to be mad if a bug report turns out to be a typo in your code. As a simple
> rule, any C-level error without a Python traceback, like a **segmentation
> fault** or **memory error**, is **always** a spaCy bug.
>
> Because models are statistical, their performance will never be _perfect_.
> However, if you come across **patterns that might indicate an underlying
> issue**, please do file a report. Similarly, we also care about behaviors that
> **contradict our docs**.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spacy): **Usage
  questions** and everything related to problems with your specific code. The
  Stack Overflow community is much larger than ours, so if your problem can be
  solved by others, you'll receive help much quicker.
- [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/explosion/spaCy): **General discussion** about
  spaCy, meeting other community members and exchanging **tips, tricks and best
  practices**.
- [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues): **Bug
  reports** and **improvement suggestions**, i.e. everything that's likely
  spaCy's fault. This also includes problems with the models beyond statistical
  imprecisions, like patterns that point to a bug.

<Infobox title="Important note" variant="warning">

Please understand that we won't be able to provide individual support via email.
We also believe that help is much more valuable if it's shared publicly, so that
**more people can benefit from it**. If you come across an issue and you think
you might be able to help, consider posting a quick update with your solution.
No matter how simple, it can easily save someone a lot of time and headache –
and the next time you need help, they might repay the favor.

### How can I contribute to spaCy? {#faq-contributing}

You don't have to be an NLP expert or Python pro to contribute, and we're happy
to help you get started. If you're new to spaCy, a good place to start is the
[`help wanted (easy)` label](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted+%28easy%29")
on GitHub, which we use to tag bugs and feature requests that are easy and
self-contained. We also appreciate contributions to the docs – whether it's
fixing a typo, improving an example or adding additional explanations. You'll
find a "Suggest edits" link at the bottom of each page that points you to the
source.

Another way of getting involved is to help us improve the
[language data](/usage/adding-languages#language-data) – especially if you
happen to speak one of the languages currently in
[alpha support](/usage/models#languages). Even adding simple tokenizer
exceptions, stop words or lemmatizer data can make a big difference. It will
also make it easier for us to provide a statistical model for the language in
the future. Submitting a test that documents a bug or performance issue, or
covers functionality that's especially important for your application is also
very helpful. This way, you'll also make sure we never accidentally introduce
regressions to the parts of the library that you care about the most.

**For more details on the types of contributions we're looking for, the code
conventions and other useful tips, make sure to check out the
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

<Infobox title="Code of Conduct" variant="warning">

spaCy adheres to the
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### I've built something cool with spaCy – how can I get the word out? {#faq-project-with-spacy}

First, congrats – we'd love to check it out! When you share your project on
Twitter, don't forget to tag [@spacy_io](https://twitter.com/spacy_io) so we
don't miss it. If you think your project would be a good fit for the
[spaCy Universe](/universe), **feel free to submit it!** Tutorials are also
incredibly valuable to other users and a great way to get exposure. So we
strongly encourage **writing up your experiences**, or sharing your code and
some tips and tricks on your blog. Since our website is open-source, you can add
your project or tutorial by making a pull request on GitHub.

If you would like to use the spaCy logo on your site, please get in touch and
ask us first. However, if you want to show support and tell others that your
project is using spaCy, you can grab one of our **spaCy badges** here:
