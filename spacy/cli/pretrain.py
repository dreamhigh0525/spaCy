'''This script is experimental.

Try pre-training the CNN component of the text categorizer using a cheap
language modelling-like objective. Specifically, we load pre-trained vectors
(from something like word2vec, GloVe, FastText etc), and use the CNN to
predict the tokens' pre-trained vectors. This isn't as easy as it sounds:
we're not merely doing compression here, because heavy dropout is applied,
including over the input words. This means the model must often (50% of the time)
use the context in order to predict the word.

To evaluate the technique, we're pre-training with the 50k texts from the IMDB
corpus, and then training with only 100 labels. Note that it's a bit dirty to
pre-train with the development data, but also not *so* terrible: we're not using
the development labels, after all --- only the unlabelled text.
