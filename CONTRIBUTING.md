# Contribute to spaCy

Following the v1.0 release, it's time to welcome more contributors into the spaCy project and code base ðŸŽ‰ This page will give you a quick overview of how things are organised and most importantly, how to get involved.

## Table of contents

## Issues and bug reports

First, [do a quick search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aexplosion) to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one.

If you're looking for help with your code, consider posting a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spacy) instead. If you tag it `spacy` and `python`, more people will see it and hopefully be able to help.

When opening an issue, use a descriptive title and include your environment (operating system, Python version, spaCy version). Our [issue template](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/new) helps you remember the most important details to include. If you've discovered a bug, you can also submit a [regression test](#fixing-bugs) straight away. When you're opening an issue to report the bug, simply refer to your pull request in the issue body.

### Tips

* **Getting info about your spaCy installation and environment**: If you're using spaCy v1.7+, you can use the command line interface to print details and even format them as Markdown to copy-paste into GitHub issues: `python -m spacy info --markdown`.

* **Sharing long blocks of code or logs**: If you need to include long code, logs or tracebacks, you can wrap them in `<details>` and `</details>`. This [collapses the content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) so it only becomes visible on click, making the issue easier to read and follow.

### Issue labels

To distinguish issues that are opened by us, the maintainers, we usually add a ðŸ’« to the title. We also use the following system to tag our issues:

| Issue label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`bug`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/labels/bug) | Bugs and behaviour differing from documentation |

## Contributing to the code base

You don't have to be an NLP expert or Python pro to contribute, and we're happy to help you get started. If you're new to spaCy, a good place to start is the [`help wanted (easy)`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted+%28easy%29%22) label, which we use to tag bugs and feature requests that are easy and self-contained. If you've decided to take on one of these problems and you're making good progress, don't forget to add a quick comment to the issue. You can also use the issue to ask questions, or share your work in progress.

### Conventions for Python

Coming soon.

### Conventions for Cython

Coming soon.

### Developer resources

The [spaCy developer resources](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-dev-resources) repo contains useful scripts, tools and templates  for developing spaCy, adding new languages and training new models. If you've written a script that might help others, feel free to contribute it to that repository.

### Contributor agreement

If you've made a substantial contribution to spaCy, you should fill in the [spaCy contributor agreement](.github/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md) to ensure that your contribution can be used across the project. If you agree to be bound by the terms of the agreement, fill in the [template]((.github/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md)) and include it with your pull request, or sumit it separately to [`.github/contributors/`](/.github/contributors). The name of the file should be your GitHub username, with the extension `.md`. For example, the user
example_user would create the file `.github/contributors/example_user.md`.


### Fixing bugs

When fixing a bug, first create an [issue](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues) if one does not already exist. The description text can be very short â€“ we don't want to make this too bureaucratic. 

Next, create a test file named `test_issue[ISSUE NUMBER].py` in the [`spacy/tests/regression`](spacy/tests/regression) folder. Test for the bug you're fixing, and make sure the test fails. Next, add and commit your test file referencing the issue number in the commit message. Finally, fix the bug, make sure your test passes and reference the issue in your commit message.

ðŸ“– **For more information on how to add tests, check out the [tests README](spacy/tests/README.md).**

## Adding tests

spaCy uses the [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) framework for testing. For more info on this, see the [pytest documentation](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html). Tests for spaCy modules and classes live in their own directories of the same name. For example, tests for the `Tokenizer` can be found in [`/spacy/tests/tokenizer`](spacy/tests/tokenizer). To be interpreted and run, all test files and test functions need to be prefixed with `test_`.

When adding tests, make sure to use descriptive names, keep the code short and concise and only test for one behaviour at a time. Try to `parametrize` test cases wherever possible, use our pre-defined fixtures for spaCy components and avoid unnecessary imports.

Extensive tests that take a long time should be marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`. Tests that require the model to be loaded should be marked with `@pytest.mark.models`. Loading the models is expensive and not necessary if you're not actually testing the model performance. If all you needs ia a `Doc` object with annotations like heads, POS tags or the dependency parse, you can use the `get_doc()` utility function to construct it manually.

ðŸ“– **For more guidelines and information on how to add tests, check out the [tests README](spacy/tests/README.md).**


## Updating the website

Our [website and docs](https://spacy.io) are implemented in [Jade/Pug](https://www.jade-lang.org), and built or served by [Harp](https://harpjs.com). Jade/Pug is an extensible templating language with a readable syntax, that compiles to HTML. Here's how to view the site locally:

```bash
sudo npm install --global harp
git clone https://github.com/explosion/spaCy
cd spaCy/website
harp server
```

The docs can always use another example or more detail, and they should always be up to date and not misleading. To quickly find the correct file to edit, simply click on the "Suggest edits" button at the bottom of a page.

To make it easy to add content components, we use a [collection of custom mixins](_includes/_mixins.jade), like `+table`, `+list` or `+code`. 

ðŸ“– **For more info and troubleshooting guides, check out the [website README](website).**

## Submitting a tutorial

Did you write a [tutorial](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/tutorials) to help others use spaCy, or did you come across one that should be added to our directory? You can submit it by making a pull request to [`website/docs/usage/_data.json`](website/docs/usage/_data.json):

```json
{
    "tutorials": {
        "deep_dives": {
            "Deep Learning with custom pipelines and Keras": {
                "url": "https://explosion.ai/blog/spacy-deep-learning-keras",
                "author": "Matthew Honnibal",
                "tags": [ "keras", "sentiment" ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### A few tips

* A suitable tutorial should provide additional content and practical examples that are not covered as such in the docs.
* Make sure to choose the right category â€“ `first_steps`, `deep_dives` (tutorials that take a deeper look at specific features) or `code` (programs and scripts on GitHub etc.).
* Don't go overboard with the tags. Take inspirations from the existing ones and only add tags for features (`"sentiment"`, `"pos"`) or integrations (`"jupyter"`, `"keras"`).
* Double-check the JSON markup and/or use a linter. A wrong or missing comma will (unfortunately) break the site rendering.

## Submitting a project to the showcase

Have you built a library, visualizer, demo or product with spaCy, or did you come across one that should be featured in our [showcase](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/showcase)? You can submit it by making a pull request to [`website/docs/usage/_data.json`](website/docs/usage/_data.json):

```json
{
    "showcase": {
        "visualizations": {
            "displaCy": {
                "url": "https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy",
                "author": "Ines Montani",
                "description": "An open-source NLP visualiser for the modern web",
                "image": "displacy.jpg"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### A few tips

* A suitable third-party library should add substantial functionality, be well-documented and open-source. If it's just a code snippet or script, consider submitting it to the `code` category of the tutorials section instead.
* A suitable demo should be hosted and accessible online. Open-source code is always a plus.
* For visualizations and products, add an image that clearly shows how it looks â€“ screenshots are ideal.
* The image should be resized to 300x188px, optimised using a tool like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) and added to [`website/assets/img/showcase`](website/assets/img/showcase).
* Double-check the JSON markup and/or use a linter. A wrong or missing comma will (unfortunately) break the site rendering.
